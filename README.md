# RESCUE-X-IOT-BASED-SMART-ACCIDENT-DETECTION-AND-EMERGENCY-DISPATCH-SYSTEM-
Description:

This project detects accidents using an ESP32 and MEMS sensor, then sends the location via GSM to a web server. Ambulance drivers can log in through a web app to view real-time accident locations on a map, allowing faster response and rescue. The system improves emergency response using IoT, sensors, and web technologies.

Abstract:

The rising number of road accidents demands an efficient emergency response system to ensure prompt medical assistance. This project introduces a Real-Time Accident Detection and IoT-Based Ambulance Dispatch System designed to enhance emergency services and public safety. The system employs advanced sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, and impact sensors to detect sudden impacts or abnormal vehicle patterns indicative of an accident. Upon detection, the data is sent to a controller that verifies the incident to minimize false alarms. Once confirmed, GSM technology transmits crucial details such as location, time, and severity to a centralized web server. This server notifies the nearest available ambulance driver through a dedicated web interface, ensuring efficient resource allocation by preventing multiple ambulances from responding to the same incident. After accepting the request, the ambulance driver can select a hospital based on proximity or medical capability. An IoT-enabled GPS module in the ambulance enables real-time route monitoring, continuously updating the path to avoid traffic congestion and other obstacles. This dynamic system optimizes response time, ensuring accident victims receive timely medical attention. By combining sensor technology, GSM communication, and IoT-based navigation, the system provides a comprehensive and automated emergency response solution.

Introduction:

The Accident Detection and Ambulance Rescue System is a smart solution designed to improve emergency response and save lives. It uses an ESP32 microcontroller, MEMS sensor, and GSM module to detect accidents and send the exact location to a centralized server. A web application is provided for ambulance drivers to log in and view real-time accident locations on a map, enabling them to reach the spot quickly. This project integrates IoT, sensor technology, and web development to create an efficient and automated system that reduces response time and enhances road safety.

Literature Survey:

1. “Fall Detection With Wrist-Worn Watch by Observations in Statistics of Acceleration”

   Author: S. Li

   Year: 2023

   Description: This paper focuses on fall detection using acceleration data from wearable devices. The statistical analysis of 
acceleration variations helps in detecting sudden movements. This work is relevant to our project as we use a MEMS sensor to detect sudden impacts caused by accidents, applying similar principles in detecting motion anomalies.

2. “A Real-Time Vision Transformers-Based System for Enhanced Driver Drowsiness Detection and Vehicle Safety”

   Authors: A. Jarndal et al.

   Year: 2025

   Description: The paper proposes a real-time system using vision transformers to monitor and detect drowsiness in drivers, aiming to reduce accidents. Although it focuses on prevention, our system complements it by acting immediately post-accident to ensure faster medical aid through automated alerts and location tracking.

3. “A Comprehensive Study on IoT Based Accident Detection Systems for Smart Vehicles”

   Authors: U. Alvi et al.

   Year: 2020

   Description: This study reviews various IoT-based accident detection systems, highlighting the role of sensors, GSM modules, and microcontrollers. It provides the foundational understanding for our project’s hardware design and the importance of GSM-based communication for emergency alerts.

4. “Smart System to Avoid Car Accidents”

   Authors: M. Saffarini et al.

   Year: 2020

   Description: This paper explores systems designed to prevent accidents using proximity sensors and automation. While it focuses on accident avoidance, our system emphasizes detection and rescue after the accident, bridging the gap between detection and immediate response.

Existing System:

Existing System
In the current scenario, most accident detection and emergency response systems are either manual or semi-automated. When an accident occurs, the victim or a bystander is usually responsible for contacting emergency services. This manual process causes significant delays in rescue operations, especially in remote or low-traffic areas. Some modern vehicles are equipped with basic onboard systems that trigger alerts during collisions, but they are often limited to luxury cars and lack integration with real-time location sharing or automated ambulance dispatch.

Additionally, existing systems generally do not include a dedicated platform for ambulance drivers to receive instant updates or view accident locations on a map. There is minimal use of IoT-based devices for real-time tracking and very little synchronization between accident detection hardware and emergency service providers.
